# Markdown Preview

This sample application consists of two services: a "markdown editor" and a separate "markdown renderer".  The environment variable, `EDITOR_UPSTREAM_RENDER_URL`, is used to point the "markdown editor" to the "markdown renderer".

Read more about how to deploy and work with these services in https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/tutorials/secure-services.
