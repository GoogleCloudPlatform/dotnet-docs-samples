# Metadata sample for Google App Engine Flexible Environment

This sample application demonstrates how to retrieve metadata when
running in Google App Engine Flexible Environment.

For detailed steps to deploy this app, you can follow
[the Google Cloud documentation](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/dotnet/create-app),
