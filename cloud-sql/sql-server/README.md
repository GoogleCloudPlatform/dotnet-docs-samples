# Google Cloud SQL with SQL Server and Google App Engine Flexible Environment

This sample application demonstrates how to store data in Google Cloud SQL
with a SQL Server database when running in Google App Engine Flexible Environment.

# Prerequisites

1.  **Follow the set-up instructions in [the documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dotnet/docs/setup).**
  
1.  Enable APIs for your project.
    [Click here](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=sqladmin.googleapis.com&showconfirmation=true)
    to visit Cloud Platform Console and enable the Google Cloud SQL API.

1.  Install the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/).  The Google Cloud SDK
    is required to deploy .NET applications to App Engine.

1.  Install the [.NET Core SDK, version 2.0](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/download-archives/2.0.5-download.md)
    or newer.

1.  Create a Cloud SQL for SQL Server instance by following these 
    [instructions](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/sqlserver/create-instance).
    Note the instance connection name, database user, and database password that you create.

1.  Create a database for your application by following these 
    [instructions](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/sqlserver/create-manage-databases).
    Note the database name. 

1.  Replace `your-project-id` in [appsettings.json](appsettings.json) with your Google Cloud Project's project id.

## Running locally

To run this application locally, download and install the `cloud_sql_proxy` by
following the instructions
[here](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/sqlserver/sql-proxy#install).

Instructions are provided below for using the proxy with a TCP connection or a Unix Domain Socket.
On Linux or Mac OS you can use either option, but on Windows the proxy currently requires a TCP connection.

### Launch proxy with TCP

To run the sample locally with a TCP connection, set environment variables and launch the proxy as shown below.

#### Linux / Mac OS
Use these terminal commands to initialize environment variables:
```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/service/account/key.json
export INSTANCE_HOST='127.0.0.1'
export DB_USER='<DB_USER_NAME>'
export DB_PASS='<DB_PASSWORD>'
export DB_NAME='<DB_NAME>'
```

Note: Saving credentials in environment variables is convenient, but not secure - consider a more secure solution such as [Cloud Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager) to help keep secrets safe.


Then use this command to launch the proxy in the background:
```bash
./cloud_sql_proxy -instances=<project-id>:<region>:<instance-name>=tcp:1433 -credential_file=$GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS &
```

Finally, run the following commands:
```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```

#### Windows/PowerShell
Use these PowerShell commands to initialize environment variables:
```powershell
$env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="<CREDENTIALS_JSON_FILE>"
$env:INSTANCE_HOST="127.0.0.1"
$env:DB_USER="<DB_USER_NAME>"
$env:DB_PASS="<DB_PASSWORD>"
$env:DB_NAME="<DB_NAME>"
```

Note: Saving credentials in environment variables is convenient, but not secure - consider a more secure solution such as [Cloud Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager) to help keep secrets safe.


Then use this command to launch the proxy in a separate PowerShell session:
```powershell
Start-Process -filepath "C:\<path to proxy exe>" -ArgumentList "-instances=<project-id>:<region>:<instance-name>=tcp:1433 -credential_file=<CREDENTIALS_JSON_FILE>"
```
Finally, run the following commands:
```psm1
PS > dotnet restore
PS > dotnet run
```
#### Visual Studio 2017

Download and run the [Google Cloud SQL Proxy](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/sqlserver/sql-proxy).

Then, navigate to the project options menu. Select the default configuration, then set the following environment variables:

```
INSTANCE_HOST : '127.0.0.1' 
DB_USER : '<DB_USER_NAME>' 
DB_PASS : '<DB_PASSWORD>'
DB_NAME : '<DB_NAME>'
```

Note: Saving credentials in environment variables is convenient, but not secure - consider a more secure solution such as [Cloud Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager) to help keep secrets safe.


Finally, run the application by clicking the arrow button in the main toolbar, or by pressing F5.


### Deploy to App Engine Flexible

1.  Edit [app.yaml](app.yaml).  Replace `<project-name>:<region>:<instance-name>`
    with your instance connection name. Update the values
    for `DB_USER`, `DB_PASS`, and `DB_NAME`

2.  Build and deploy the application:

    #### Powershell
    ```psm1
    PS > dotnet restore
    PS > dotnet publish
    PS > gcloud beta app deploy .\bin\Debug\netcoreapp2.1\publish\app.yaml
    ```
        #### Bash
    ```bash
    dotnet restore
    dotnet publish
    gcloud beta app deploy ./bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.1/publish/app.yaml
    ```
