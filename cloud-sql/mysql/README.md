# Google Cloud SQL with MySQL Sample for Cloud Run and Google App Engine Flexible Environment

This sample application demonstrates how to store data in Google Cloud SQL
with a MySQL database when running in Cloud Run or Google App Engine Flexible Environment.

## Prerequisites

1.  **Follow the set-up instructions in [the documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dotnet/docs/setup).**
  
1.  Enable APIs for your project.
    [Click here](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=sqladmin.googleapis.com&showconfirmation=true)
    to visit Cloud Platform Console and enable the Google Cloud SQL API.

1.  Install the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/).  The Google Cloud SDK
    is required to deploy .NET applications to App Engine.

1.  Install the [.NET Core SDK, version 2.0](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/download-archives/2.0.5-download.md)
    or newer.

1.  Create a Cloud SQL for Postgres instance by following these 
    [instructions](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/create-instance).
    Note the connection string, database user, and database password that you create.

1.  Create a database for your application by following these 
    [instructions](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/create-manage-databases).
    Note the database name. 

1.  Replace `your-project-id` in [appsettings.json](appsettings.json) with your Google Cloud Project's project id.

## Running locally

To run this application locally, download and install the `cloud_sql_proxy` by
following the instructions
[here](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/sql-proxy#install).

Instructions are provided below for using the proxy with a TCP connection or a Unix Domain Socket.
On Linux or Mac OS you can use either option, but on Windows the proxy currently requires a TCP connection.

### Launch proxy with TCP

To run the sample locally with a TCP connection, set environment variables and launch the proxy as shown below.

#### Linux / Mac OS
Use these terminal commands to initialize environment variables:
```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/service/account/key.json
export DB_HOST='127.0.0.1'
export DB_USER='<DB_USER_NAME>'
export DB_PASS='<DB_PASSWORD>'
export DB_NAME='<DB_NAME>'
```

Note: Saving credentials in environment variables is convenient, but not secure - consider a more secure solution such as [Cloud Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager) to help keep secrets safe.


Then use this command to launch the proxy in the background:
```bash
./cloud_sql_proxy -instances=<project-id>:<region>:<instance-name>=tcp:5432 -credential_file=$GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS &
```

Finally, run the following commands:
```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```

#### Windows/PowerShell
Use these PowerShell commands to initialize environment variables:
```powershell
$env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="<CREDENTIALS_JSON_FILE>"
$env:DB_HOST="127.0.0.1"
$env:DB_USER="<DB_USER_NAME>"
$env:DB_PASS="<DB_PASSWORD>"
$env:DB_NAME="<DB_NAME>"
```

Note: Saving credentials in environment variables is convenient, but not secure - consider a more secure solution such as [Cloud Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager) to help keep secrets safe.


Then use this command to launch the proxy in a separate PowerShell session:
```powershell
Start-Process -filepath "C:\<path to proxy exe>" -ArgumentList "-instances=<project-id>:<region>:<instance-name>=tcp:5432 -credential_file=<CREDENTIALS_JSON_FILE>"
```
Finally, run the following commands:
```psm1
PS > dotnet restore
PS > dotnet run
```
#### Visual Studio 2017

Download and run the [Google Cloud SQL Proxy](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/sql-proxy).

Then, navigate to the project options menu. Select the default configuration, then set the following environment variables:

```
DB_HOST : '127.0.0.1' 
DB_USER : '<DB_USER_NAME>' 
DB_PASS : '<DB_PASSWORD>'
DB_NAME : '<DB_NAME>'
```

Note: Saving credentials in environment variables is convenient, but not secure - consider a more secure solution such as [Cloud Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager) to help keep secrets safe.


Finally, run the application by clicking the arrow button in the main toolbar, or by pressing F5.

### Launch proxy with Unix Domain Socket
NOTE: this option is currently only supported on Linux and Mac OS. Windows users should use the [Launch proxy with TCP](#launch-proxy-with-tcp) option.

To use a Unix socket, you'll need to create a directory and give write access to the user running the proxy. For example:
```bash
sudo mkdir ./cloudsql
sudo chown -R $USER ./cloudsql
```

You'll also need to initialize an environment variable containing the directory you just created:

```bash
export DB_SOCKET_DIR=./cloudsql
```

Use these terminal commands to initialize environment variables:
```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/service/account/key.json
export INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME='<MY-PROJECT>:<INSTANCE-REGION>:<INSTANCE-NAME>'
export DB_USER='<DB_USER_NAME>'
export DB_PASS='<DB_PASSWORD>'
export DB_NAME='<DB_NAME>'
```


Then use this command to launch the proxy in the background:
```bash
./cloud_sql_proxy -dir=$DB_SOCKET_DIR --instances=$INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME --credential_file=$GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS &

Finally, run the following commands:
```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```

### Deploy to Cloud Run

See the [Cloud Run documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/connect-run)
for more details on connecting a Cloud Run service to Cloud SQL.

Build the container image:

```sh
gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]/run-sql
```

Deploy the service to Cloud Run. Replace environment variables with the correct values for your Cloud SQL instance configuration:

```sh
gcloud run deploy run-sql --image gcr.io/[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]/run-sql \              
  --add-cloudsql-instances '<MY-PROJECT>:<INSTANCE-REGION>:<INSTANCE-NAME>' \
  --set-env-vars INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME='<MY-PROJECT>:<INSTANCE-REGION>:<INSTANCE-NAME>' \
  --set-env-vars DB_USER='<DB_USER_NAME>' \
  --set-env-vars DB_PASS='<DB_PASSWORD>' \
  --set-env-vars DB_NAME='<DB_NAME>'
```

Take note of the URL output at the end of the deployment process and navigate your browser to that URL.

It is recommended to use the [Secret Manager integration](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/secrets) for Cloud Run instead
of using environment variables for the SQL configuration. The service injects the SQL credentials from
Secret Manager at runtime via an environment variable.

Create secrets via the command line:
```sh
echo -n $INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME | \
    gcloud secrets create [CLOUD_SQL_CONNECTION_NAME_SECRET] --data-file=-
```

Deploy the service to Cloud Run specifying the env var name and secret name:
```sh
gcloud beta run deploy SERVICE --image gcr.io/[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]/run-sql \
    --add-cloudsql-instances $INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME \
    --update-secrets CLOUD_SQL_CONNECTION_NAME=[CLOUD_SQL_CONNECTION_NAME_SECRET]:latest,\
      DB_USER=[DB_USER_SECRET]:latest, \
      DB_PASS=[DB_PASS_SECRET]:latest, \
      DB_NAME=[DB_NAME_SECRET]:latest
```

For more details about using Cloud Run see http://cloud.run.

### Deploy to App Engine Flexible

1.  Edit [app.yaml](app.yaml).  Replace `your-project-id:us-central1:instance-name`
    with your instance connection name, and update the tcp port number to 
    `5432` for a PostgreSQL instance or `3306` for a MySQL instance. Update the values
    for `DB_USER`, `DB_PASS`, and `DB_NAME`

2.  Build and deploy the application:

    #### Powershell
    ```psm1
    PS > dotnet restore
    PS > dotnet publish
    PS > gcloud beta app deploy .\bin\Debug\netcoreapp2.1\publish\app.yaml
    ```
        #### Bash
    ```bash
    dotnet restore
    dotnet publish
    gcloud beta app deploy ./bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.1/publish/app.yaml
    ```
