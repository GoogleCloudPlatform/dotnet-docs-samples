# Cloud Retail Search 

These samples demonstrate how to interact with the [Cloud Retail Search API](https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs) from C# and
the .NET client libraries to call the Retail API.

The samples requires [.NET Core 3.1](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core) or later.  That means using
[Visual Studio 2019](https://www.visualstudio.com/), or the command line.

## Setup

4.  [Set up your project and enable Retail API](https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/setting-up).
