class and unfortunately I picked this version. Everything from the acting
(the actors deliver most of their lines directly to the camera) to the camera
shots (all medium or close up shots...no scenery shots and very little back
ground in the shots) were absolutely terrible. I watched this over my spring
break and it is very safe to say that I feel that I was gypped out of 114
minutes of my vacation. Not recommended by any stretch of the imagination.

Something surprised me about this movie - it was actually original. It was
not the same old recycled crap that comes out of Hollywood every month. I saw
this movie on video because I did not even know about it before I saw it at my
local video store. If you see this movie available - rent it - you will not
regret it.

My family has watched Arthur Bach stumble and stammer since the movie first
came out. We have most lines memorized. I watched it two weeks ago and still
get tickled at the simple humor and view-at-life that Dudley Moore portrays.
Liza Minelli did a wonderful job as the side kick - though I'm not her
biggest fan. This movie makes me just enjoy watching movies. My favorite scene
is when Arthur is visiting his fianc√©e's house. His conversation with the
butler and Susan's father is side-spitting. The line from the butler,
""Would you care to wait in the Library"" followed by Arthur's reply,
""Yes I would, the bathroom is out of the question"" is my NEWMAIL
notification on my computer.

This Charles outing is decent but this is a pretty low-key performance. Marlon
Brando stands out. There's a subplot with Mira Sorvino and Donald Sutherland
that forgets to develop and it hurts the film a little. I'm still trying to
figure out why Charlie want to change his name.
