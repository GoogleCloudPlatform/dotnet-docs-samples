# Google Endpoints and Google App Engine Flexible Environment

This sample application demonstrates how to implement a Google Endpoint
with a .NET Core application running in Google App Engine Flexible Environment.

## Prerequisites

1.  **Follow the set-up instructions in [the documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dotnet/docs/setup).**

2.  Install the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/).  The Google Cloud SDK
    is required to deploy .NET applications to App Engine.

2.  Install the [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core).

2.  Visual Studio is not required, but to build and run .NET Core applications,
    Visual Studio 2017 users need to download and install
    [.NET Core tools](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/windows).

3.  [Google Cloud Tools for Visual Studio](
    https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GoogleCloudTools.GoogleCloudPlatformExtensionforVisualStudio)
    make it easy to deploy to App Engine.  Install them if you are running Visual Studio.

4.  Follow the instructions in the [Quickstart for Endpoints on App Engine Flexible Environment](
    https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/quickstart-app-engine).
